# Retail Sales Management System

A full-stack Retail Sales Management System built as part of the TruEstate SDE Intern Assignment.  
The system provides advanced Search, Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination features over structured sales data with a clean modular architecture.  
Both backend and frontend are optimized for performance, maintainability, and real-world engineering practices.

##  Tech Stack

### **Frontend**
- React (Vite)
- Axios
- Custom hooks & services architecture
- Netlify Deployment

### **Backend**
- Node.js + Express
- CORS
- Modular service + controller architecture
- Render Deployment

---

##  Search Implementation Summary
- Full-text search implemented on:
  - Customer Name  
  - Phone Number  
- Case-insensitive matching  
- Search works in combination with filters, sorting & pagination  
- Optimized using O(n) filtering on pre-loaded dataset  

---

##  Filter Implementation Summary
Supports multi-select and range filters:

- Customer Region  
- Gender  
- Age Range  
- Product Category  
- Tags  
- Payment Method  
- Date Range  

Filter behaviour:
- Works independently or in combination  
- Maintains state alongside search & sorting  
- Handles conflicting filters gracefully (returns empty dataset)  
- Tag filtering supports comma-separated tags  

---

##  Sorting Implementation Summary
Sorting available on:
- Date (Newest First / Oldest First)  
- Quantity  
- Customer Name (A–Z / Z–A)

Sorting:
- Applied after filtering & search  
- Stable sort with predictable order  

---

##  Pagination Implementation Summary
- Page size: **10 items per page**  
- Next / Previous navigation supported  
- Returns:
  - totalItems  
  - totalPages  
  - currentPage  
  - hasNextPage  
  - hasPrevPage  

Pagination respects active filters, search, and sorting.

##  Edge Case Handling
- No results → Shows “No results found”
- Conflicting filters → Returns empty dataset safely
- Invalid numeric ranges → Sanitized before filter evaluation
- Missing optional fields → Default fallbacks used
- Large filter combinations → Efficient in-memory processing

---

##  Assignment Compliance
- Fully modular architecture  
- Clean, readable, maintainable code  
- Strict separation of frontend & backend  
- No autogenerated code  
- Matches structural design guidelines
